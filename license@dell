Dell machines often come with OEM Windows licenses embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware. These licenses are used to automatically activate Windows without requiring manual input of a product key. 

To check or manage licenses on Dell machines, here are key points and PowerShell commands:

- You can retrieve the embedded Windows product key from the BIOS with this PowerShell command:  
  ```powershell
  (Get-WmiObject -query 'select * from SoftwareLicensingService').OA3xOriginalProductKey
  ```
  This returns the original OEM license key if present.  
- To manually install this key and attempt activation (for example after OS reinstall), you can use `slmgr.vbs` commands with the extracted key:  
  ```powershell
  $Key = (Get-WmiObject -query 'select * from SoftwareLicensingService').OA3xOriginalProductKey
  slmgr.vbs -ipk $Key
  slmgr.vbs -ato
  ```
  This sets the product key and tries to activate Windows.  
- Dell also provides PowerShell modules such as "Dell Command | PowerShell Provider" to manage BIOS and system features, but activation is mostly handled via built-in Windows tooling.  
- If activation fails after reinstall, using the built-in Windows Activation Troubleshooter or contacting Dell Support is advised.  
- For Office licenses pre-installed in Dell machines, scripted detection can be complex and may require different approaches.

In summary, Dell machines typically have OEM licenses embedded in firmware accessible via PowerShell and WMI, and activation can be automated using retrieved product keys and slmgr.vbs commands.
