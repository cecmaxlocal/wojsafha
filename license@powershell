PowerShell itself, as a scripting language and environment developed by Microsoft, is free to use and open source. However, when people refer to "PowerShell license," they often mean licenses associated with Microsoft products managed or automated via PowerShell, such as Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

Key points on PowerShell and licenses:

- PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell are licensed under Microsoft Software License Terms and are officially free to download and use across platforms [general knowledge].
- PowerShell is often used to manage Microsoft 365 licenses, user assignments, and services via cmdlets. For example, Microsoft 365 licensing plans (E3, E5, etc.) and service licenses are assigned, viewed, and managed via PowerShell modules targeting Microsoft Graph or Azure AD.[1][2][3]
- These licenses (Microsoft 365 subscriptions) represent paid services and products from Microsoft, and PowerShell scripts help automate license assignment, status checks, and compliance monitoring.[4][5][1]
- PowerShell modules for Microsoft 365 management, such as MSOnline or Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, are themselves under Microsoft's open-source or proprietary licensing but allow managing user licenses effectively [general knowledge].
- To manage Microsoft licenses with PowerShell, you typically authenticate and use cmdlets like `Get-MgSubscribedSku`, `Set-MgUserLicense`, and others to assign or review licenses.[2][3]

Summary:
- PowerShell as software is free and open source under Microsoft license.
- It is a powerful tool for managing Microsoft product licenses (Microsoft 365, Azure, Office licenses).
- The licenses it manages belong to paid Microsoft products and require proper subscription and compliance.
- PowerShell’s role is to facilitate license administration via automation scripting.

If you want scripts or detailed guidance for managing specific licenses with PowerShell, feel free to ask.[5][1][2]
